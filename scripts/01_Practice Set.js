// Practice Set 
// Q1 Create a string vaariable and add a integer variable to it 

let name = "Pratoon";
let marks = 89;

let concatinatedValue = name + marks;
console.log(concatinatedValue);
/*
Whenever the String and number is added using + operater it is concatinated meaning it will be added as one whole string.
 Output For the above will be :- Pratoon89 
 The Type of The Output will be string. 
*/

// Q2 Get the type of variable that is having a sum of name and marks using typeof. 
console.log(typeof(concatinatedValue));
// the type of name is string

// Q3 Create a const object in javascript can you chnage it to hold a number later
const obj = {
    name : "Pratoon",
    section : 1,
    isPrinciple : false
}
//obj = 56;  This will throw error as refrence cannot be defined again.

// Q4 Try to add a new key to the previous object you created

obj['name']= "Peter Griffin"
obj['schoolName']= "Little Flower House"
console.log(obj);
/*
Tip to replicate the line in vs code  windows alt+shift+downArrow in mac option + shift + downArrow

 We can add new key and values to a const object as  the refrence is p
 ointing to a object in a memory and we can change the value
 of any key in the objects as shown above
